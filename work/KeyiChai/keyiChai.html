                    The project hopes to enhance the resilience of the Braddock waterfront 
                    and riparian space by softening the water and the edge of the city,
                    bringing people and other species to the river. The core of our vision 
                    is to provide a clean and open riverside space for all residents of 
                    Braddock, North Braddock, and nearby communities.

                <p class="full-paragraph">
                    Some of the key ecological issues at the Braddock waterfront include a fragile 
                    and fragmented shoreline, characterized by industrial and other forms of pollution, 
                    flood risk, and a hardscaped built environment. The river bank ecology of Braddock 
                    is relatively fragile. Combined sewage outfalls are located along the riverbanks,
                    and industrial effluent mixed with domestic sewage is discharged into the river
                    affecting water quality and threatening fish and waterfowl habitats. A large area
                    of the riverbank is easily flooded and many buildings are affected. The riverbanks
                    are also covered with little vegetation and most of the riverbanks have been
                    hardscaped. The connection between the water and the shoreline is cut off by 
                    the retaining walls.

                <p class="small-title">Ecological Elements of Braddock</p>
                <p>The proposal is predicated on community collaborations with organizations such as 
                    the Friends of the Riverfront to help enable conversations with waterfront landowners 
                    for the opening of the riverfront. In terms of development intensity, priority 
                    should be given to ecological and recreational functions so that residents can 
                    interact with nature in a relaxed and enjoyable manner. Considering the ecological 
                    restoration process of the riverbank and the difficulty of developing the site, 
                    a small degree of development should be adopted and should be carried out in phases.

                <P class="full-paragraph">The proposal builds on existing efforts at riverfront restoration and 
                    trail development in the Pittsburgh area, including the Great Allegheny 
                    Passage and Three Rivers Heritage Trail. It involves transforming the
                    railroad into an ecological corridor to increase resilience to climate change,
                    and build spaces for recreation and conservation along this ecological 
                    corridor. It would include the planting of native species along the river 
                    to reshape the diversity of the plant community, filter pollutants, absorb 
                    stormwater, beautify the landscape, and create habitat for birds and other 
                    river animals. The project is proposed in a series of stages.
