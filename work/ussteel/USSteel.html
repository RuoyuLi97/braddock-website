                    The Edgar Thomson steel works has operated at the banks of 
the Monongahela River for over a hundred years since its establishment in 
1872. The decline of the steel industry and the environmental effects of the 
plant have affected the lives of people in its surrounding communities in 
various ways. Discussion with community members and attendance at resident-led 
town halls has shaped our understanding of this plant and its impact on the 
community. With the help of these voices, we have proposed a future vision, 
which over the course of three long-term phases, maps out a transition to 
cleaner industry, and opportunities to enhance the local ecology, restorate 
land, and to create community infrastructures and open spaces. In the 
following pages we elaborate on these three phases.

                            We propose green spaces around the site’s 
periphery. These green spaces will act as a buffer between the community and 
the plant, and aid in reducing air and noise pollution. Trees also help in 
purifying the air by <span class="paragraph-highlight">absorbing gaseous air around</span>. Trees like Willow (Salix 
species), Silver Birch, and Poplar (Populus deltoides) can be used for 
phytoremediation. In this process, <span class="paragraph-highlight">plants are used to extract and remove 
elemental pollutants from the land and aid in land restoration</span>. We also 
propose pedestrian trails along with the green buffer so that people’s daily 
life experiences are enhanced, while <span class="paragraph-highlight">creating greater opportunities to engage 
the site</span>.

NBRFOF and others. We also propose to incorporate this area as part of the buffer.

                        reestablishing the historic creek system. We also propose a rain garden
                        along the turtle creek which could show down the rainwater flow and 
                        enhance the soil. The objective behind this is to start to rejuvenate
                        the broader ecology of the site and reduce the conditions and effects
                        of toxicity.
