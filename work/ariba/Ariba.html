                <p class="full-paragraph">
                    This project investigates gaps within the health
landscape of Braddock, and proposes creating
connections to build a stronger network between
existing facilities and the community. The goal is
to use a central location as an anchor and support
for other efforts that already exist within the
community.
                </p>
                <img class="full-image-larger" src="Flow diagram.jpg">
                <p class="full-paragraph">
                    The Free Clinic was established by the Muslim
Council of American Foundation after the closing
of the UPMC Braddock Hospital in 2009, particularly
to provide health care to uninsured people
in Braddock and surrounding communities .
Currently the clinic uses space in the Braddock
Borough Municipal Building and has been able to
achieve some of its short term goals. There is an
adult primary care facility that operates only on
the weekends as the doctors work on a volunteer
basis. While the clinic has been slowly expanding
since its inception, with the addition of additional
exam rooms and support spaces, the long term
goal of the clinic includes transforming it into a
full-time facility that provides a range of services
for every community member free of cost.
                </p>
                <h2 class="main-header">Proposal</h2>
                <p class="full-paragraph">
                    This project aims to create a system to <span class="paragraph-highlight">fill the
existing gaps and help achieve the long-term
goals of the Free Clinic, so that it can cater to
community needs in a better way</span>. </p>
                <img class="full-image-top" src="Context.jpg">
                <p class="full-paragraph">As access to
funding has been one of the biggest concerns for
the clinic, Allegheny County Health Department’s
Clean Air Fund and the Air Quality Ambassador
Mini-grant Program are identified as potential
funding sources. Currently the Clean Air fund is
more focused on pollution reduction projects,
but the proposal argues to use it to cure the
damage caused due to the health and environmental
injustices for residents of Braddock and
neighboring communities. The lack of doctors
and support staff can be fulfilled by bringing 
in various organizations that are currently operating 
in Braddock, many of whom rely on space and other 
facilities provided by the Carnegie Library. 
These include Olie’s Angels, Healthy Start, Senior 
Project 15104, Women for Healthy Environment and Pittsburgh 
Black Breastfeeding Group. Bringing various groups under one 
holistic spatial and organizational structure will help develop
 confidence among donors. I also propose that the facility’s
eligibility be expanded to cater to underinsured, rather than 
just uninsured, residents.
                </p>
                <p class="full-paragraph">
                The facility is planned to provide spaces for seniors, 
children and women of the community. Various support programs 
have been introduced to ameliorate the overall well-being of 
these members of the community. Creating relationships between 
indoor and outdoor spaces will help to enhance engagement and 
accessibility opportunities.
