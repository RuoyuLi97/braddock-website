                        Braddock Carnegie Library Association (BCLA)
                    </span> 
serves the communities of Braddock, North Braddock, East Pittsburgh, Chalfant, 
and Turtle Creek, with almost 15,000 people. It not only provides library 
services but also carries many community service functions. BCLA is proud to 
build its program based on what the community needs, which includes but is not 
limited to culture, art, education, and more. BCLA provides assistance to local 
residents in their daily lives and provides facilities and venues for other 
institutions. BCLA holds learning and teaching studios to help local people 
acquire skills for sustainable development, and it plays a great role in the 
education of local teenagers. Through communication with local residents and 
information obtained from the workshop, it is obvious that Braddock Carnegie
Library has become an indispensable part of the local community.

                    However, due to historical reasons and economic problems, 
the renovation progress of the original museum building has been slow. At 
present, the book resources of BCLA are placed in about 90 square meters of 
space on Braddock Avenue, and events are held at the Braddock’s Battlefield
History Center.

                <p class="full-paragraph">
                    BCLA also provides a variety of services within other 
community spaces, such as in playgrounds, schools, or other public spaces. 
The BCLA is closely connected with, and supports, many other community-based 
infrastructures, and the mode of cooperation and the way of providing services 
still has much potential. It is the network formed by these organizations and 
institutions that jointly serve Braddock rather than one alone. In addition, 
residents’ demands for BCLA are not limited to the library.

                        BCLA should not be limited by physical space.
                    </span> 
                    What’s more, BCLA has many infrastructures that can be 
applied, but it has not been well applied under the current situation.

                <p class="main full-paragraph">
                    After mapping the resources provided by BCLA and having a 
deeper understanding of the interaction between BCLA and residents, I realize 
that providing a larger physical space for BCLA is not the best solution. 
                </p>
                <p class="main full-paragraph">
                    Combined with the existing resources and infrastructure of 
BCLA and the specific needs of residents, this project proposes
                    <span class="paragraph-highlight">
                        a mobile module system
                    </span>
to help BCLA and related institutions provide a range of community services. 
These modules can be assembled and transported to different locations by 
trailer or pickup truck. BCLA staff can arrange the modules according to 
specific needs. At present, the function of the module is to extend the 
functions provided by the existing infrastructure and break through the 
limitation of physical space. But in the future, it may become a mobile system 
jointly used and managed by community infrastructure.

                        I designed a mobile modules system to help BCLA and 
relevant institutions provide services for the community. These modules can be 
modularly assembled and transported to the community by trailer or pickup 
truck. The owner (BCLA) can arrange the modules according to specific needs. 
At present, the function of the module is to extend the functions provided by 
the existing infrastructure and break through the limitation of physical

                        By combining modules with different functions and 
placing them in different places, the modules will create different place 
types in the surrounding venues and provide a variety of activities. For 
example, if a "chess" module (loaded with chess and tables and chairs), a 
"Gallery" module, and a "bookshelf" module are placed next to a community 
park, it will become a temporary community library and activity center, which 
can create a space for children's learning and entertainment.
