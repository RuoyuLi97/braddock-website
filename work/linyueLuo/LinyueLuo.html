                    This proposal addresses issues of food security and 
provision in Braddock and North Braddock, and provides spaces for gathering and 
sharing meals, by retrofitting the former Superior Motors restaurant into a new 
Community Canteen.

                <p class="full-paragraph">
                    The project adapts most of the original Superior Motors 
interior plan, which includes the kitchen and sitting areas. It makes the 
kitchen space more open and offers greater functionality and flexibility. On 
regular days, residents can come to the canteen for meals and to gather. The 
space is also a culinary school, which could provide opportunities for 
residents to learn cooking skills. Residents could even bring their materials 
and cook freely here, or they could order meals with lower prices. Meanwhile, 
there are also some office spaces and other rooms in the Canteen which members 
of the community could reserve for meetings or other gatherings.
                </p>
                <p class="full-paragraph">
                    On special occasions, the canteen would host community 
activities, in partnership with the Community Oven. A large outdoor space, 
which is currently a parking lot and open space, is attached to the Community 
Canteen. Here we propose an edible garden along with a Garden Resource Center, 
managed by Grow Pittsburgh. All the food grown in the garden could be used
in the Canteen, and also sold to residents at low prices. Residents who need 
tools, fertilizers, or other materials to start or maintain their own gardens 
could visit the Garden Resource Center and get assistance. Moreover, in the 
proposal, the old Orchard has now returned back to the community. People could 
come here to enjoy leisure time with their families and friends. Finally we 
propose, in the future, that the Canteen also has a mobile food pantry which 
would supply food and products directly to residents who may not be able to 
access the Canteen.
